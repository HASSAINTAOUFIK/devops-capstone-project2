You have been asked by the customer account manager at your company to develop an account microservice to keep track of the customers on your e-commerce website. Since it is a microservice, it is expected to have a well-formed REST API that other microservices can call. This service initially needs to create, read, update, delete, and list customers.

You have also been told that someone else has started on this task. They have already developed the database model and a Python Flask-based REST API with an endpoint to create a customer account. You just need to plan to add the REST APIs to read, update, delete, and list accounts. Since you will be working in an online lab environment, you will need to plan your work to get that environment ready for development.
